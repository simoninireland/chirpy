This library would not exist without BirdNET to do the hard work of
acoustic signal classification. Placing this model into the public
domain was an act of massive scientific generosity for which we're
extremely grateful.

The Raspberry Pi family of devices provide several platforms that can
run ``chirpy`` in tethered or unattended (sensor) configurations.
Having these device makes tiny machine learning available without
needing bespoke hardware.
